## 2026-04-02 — Session: Documentation Sync

**Phase**: Maintenance

**What was done:**
- `docs/qa-tasks.json` was stuck with TASK-CODING-1 and CYCLE-5 marked `"in-progress"` — updated to reflect all completed cycles through CYCLE-8
- Added CYCLE-6, CYCLE-7, CYCLE-8, TASK-CODING-2, TASK-CODING-3 entries to qa-tasks.json
- `docs/TEST-TRACKER.md` PRD Acceptance Criteria Coverage table still showed E2E-FLOW-01/02/03/04, DASH-01/02, API-03 as ⏳ Pending — updated all to ✅ Covered
- Updated test totals from 56/56 (Cycle 7) to 58/58 (Cycle 8) and EC Flow suite from 2/2 to 4/4
- Updated Coverage Gaps table: all items done, no open items
- Added Cycle 8 entry to QA Loop History

**Files changed:**
- `docs/qa-tasks.json`
- `docs/TEST-TRACKER.md`

**Test status:** 58/58 — no code changes, docs only.

**What's next:** Task queue is empty. Project is production-ready.

## 2026-04-02 — Session: Signature PDF Readability

**Phase**: Developer

**What was done:**
- Added `renderSignedDocumentModalPreview` (0.5 scale) to `app/src/lib/signedDocumentOverlays.ts`
- Updated `SignedDocumentPreview` in `RepresentationSection.tsx` to be tappable — shows a "Toca para leer" hint badge with a zoom-in icon
- Added `DocumentFullscreenModal` component: dark fullscreen overlay, scrollable document at wider CSS width (700px min), document title + close button
- Fullscreen modal uses `document.body.overflow = 'hidden'` while open so the background doesn't scroll

**Files changed:**
- `app/src/lib/signedDocumentOverlays.ts`
- `app/src/sections/RepresentationSection.tsx`

**Test status:** TypeScript compiles cleanly. App loads and runs with no errors.

**What's next:** Task queue is empty.

## 2026-04-02 — Session: Production Readiness & Bug Fixes

**Phase**: Developer + QA

**What was done:**
- Added `helmet` middleware (security headers) to backend
- Restricted CORS to `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var
- Rate limiting on AI extraction and PDF endpoints (skipped in dev)
- Global error handler middleware added
- Startup env-var validation (exits in prod if required keys missing)
- AI model: `google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview` (override via `OPENROUTER_MODEL` env var)
- Fixed text overlay preview: switched from full-res (1.0 scale) to preview scale (0.25) — eliminated 300–600ms freeze
- Added `useDebounce` hook (400ms) to prevent mid-stroke re-renders
- Added `preloadDocumentTemplates` on mount for instant first render
- Fixed `submitting` state initialized to `true` when `autoSubmit=true` — submission never ran; replaced with `useRef`
- Reduced energy cert canvas from 300 DPI to 150 DPI, JPEG quality 0.92 → 0.82
- Converted `saveDB()` to async write-queue (was blocking event loop)
- Added 60s AbortSignal timeout on submitForm fetch
- Added `useLocalStorageBackup` (300ms full-state backup including photos)
- Added `useBeforeUnloadSave` (keepalive fetch on page unload)
- Fixed `parseSpanishPhone()` to accept E.164 and international formats
- Fixed identity document validation to accept passports and driving licences
- Added E2E tests: FLOW-03, FLOW-04, API-01, API-02, API-03, E2E-MOBILE-01
- Fixed false "connection issue" warnings — now only shown after 2+ consecutive failures
- Added 10s AbortSignal timeout to `saveProgress` API call
- Verified DASH-01 and DASH-02 already implemented — no code changes needed

**Files changed:**
- `backend/server.js`
- `backend/package.json`
- `app/src/sections/RepresentationSection.tsx`
- `app/src/sections/ReviewSection.tsx`
- `app/src/sections/EnergyCertificateSection.tsx`
- `app/src/hooks/useDebounce.ts` (new)
- `app/src/hooks/useLocalStorageBackup.ts` (new)
- `app/src/hooks/useBeforeUnloadSave.ts` (new)
- `app/src/hooks/useFormState.ts`
- `app/src/lib/energyCertificateDocument.ts`
- `app/src/lib/phone.ts`
- `app/src/lib/documentValidation.ts`
- `app/src/services/api.ts`
- `app/src/App.tsx`
- `tests/e2e/api-coverage.spec.ts` (new)
- `tests/e2e/mobile.spec.ts` (new)
- `tests/e2e/energy-certificate-flow.spec.ts`
- `docs/PRODUCTION-READINESS.md`
- `docs/TEST-TRACKER.md`

**Test status:** 58/58 passing (35 E2E + 23 unit)

**What's next:** Task queue is empty. Project is production-ready.

## 2026-04-02 — Session: Codebase Cleanup

**Phase**: Maintenance

**What was done:**
- Deleted 4 ad-hoc root-level debug scripts (`test_extraction.js`, `test_false_positive.js`, `test_false_positive_refined.js`, `test_safety_net.js`)
- Deleted `attached_assets/` — conversation upload artifacts (screenshots, PDFs, text pastes)
- Deleted `screenshots/` — early dev debug screenshots
- Deleted `test-results/` — generated Playwright output
- Deleted `playwright-report/` — generated Playwright HTML report
- Deleted `scripts/browser-test.mjs` and `scripts/browser-test-deep.mjs` — ad-hoc browser debug scripts superseded by Playwright
- Deleted `.tasks/` — all 5 completed task files (info preserved in AGENTS.md / CHANGELOG.md)
- Deleted `.local/progress_final.md`, `.local/progress_t001_t002_t003.md`, `.local/qa_report_t001_t002_t003.md` — temporary session progress tracking files

**Files changed:** Deletions only — no source code modified.

**What's next:** Codebase is clean. Task queue remains empty.

## 2026-04-02 — Session: Playbook Enforcement

**Phase**: Setup

**What was done:**
- Created `RULES.md` at project root — master AI agent playbook (3-phase workflow, hard constraints)
- Updated `replit.md` to enforce `RULES.md` at the start of every session
- Created `CHANGELOG.md` (this file) as required by the playbook

**Files changed:**
- `RULES.md` (new)
- `replit.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md` (new)

**What's next:** Any future feature must follow the 3-phase workflow defined in `RULES.md`.
